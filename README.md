## ProjectAspire
Internal training software for CS:GO

## Background
I was working on this for quite a while. Some of the code isn't very well written, but the majority is stable and optimized. Maybe you can use this source to learn from.

## Final additions
Prior to releasing the source, here is the final changelog by me:
```- Fixed significant aimbot bug that prevented lock on
- Fixed config saving / loading
- Fixed triggerbot delay
- Added custom aimbot target selection (Crosshair, Distance, Health)
- Added display active hotkeys
- Renamed "Spectated disable" to "First-person spectated disable"
- Code improvements
- Config name is now unique to you (i.e: 1887394722)

Todo:
- Fixed possible VAC bans from occurring when using
- Fixed random crashes
- Fixed ESP showing in first-person spectate
```
